## Installation

### Npm

```bash
npm install @coreui/react @coreui/coreui
```

If you use CoreUI PRO version.

```bash
npm install @coreui/react-pro @coreui/coreui-pro
```

### Yarn

```bash
yarn add @coreui/react @coreui/coreui
```

If you use CoreUI PRO version.

```bash
yarn add @coreui/react-pro @coreui/coreui-pro
```


## Using components

```jsx
import { CAlert } from '@coreui/react';

// CoreUI PRO version
import { CAlert } from '@coreui/react-pro';
```

## Stylesheets

React components are styled using the `@coreui/coreui` or `@coreui/coreui-pro` CSS library, but you can also use them with the bootstrap CSS library. That is possible because the `@coreui/coreui` library is compatible with Bootstrap, it just extends its functionalities. The only exceptions are custom CoreUI and CoreUI PRO components, which don't exist in the Bootstrap ecosystem.
